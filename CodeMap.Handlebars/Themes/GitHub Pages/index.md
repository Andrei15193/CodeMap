Themes in this category are aimed to generate websites that are hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and take advantage of [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) features to provide more features than plain web pages, such as being able to host multiple versions of the documentation and have the navigation automatically updated, as well as displaying banners when a version becomes outdated.

All of this is done through [Liquid's Shopify](https://shopify.dev/api/liquid) syntax. The [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) templates generate pages that will be processed by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) during deployment, some of which contain only front matter while others contain Liquid syntax as well. This will generate web pages that use minimal, or no JavaScript at all, eliminating any lag time a user may have when accessing the website.
