Alright, so, no front matter is required (unless you want to change things)

Follow the post filename constraints and ALL will be GOOD. Yep, that's it.

### To Do

* Add posts copy constraints, posts only on the `dev` branch should be published
* Tags might be useful, for architecture decision records
* Add blog index/paginated landing page, and add it to the navigation
